    <h1>Subject: Urgent: Security Problems Detected in Software Development.
        Dear team, I hope you are well. I want to report a critical security
        issue we have detected in our software development.</h1>
    
        Problem Description: During a recent security review, several vulnerabilities were identified in our system,<br>
        including possible SQL injections, lack of input validation in user forms, and unencrypted data transmission.<br>
        These vulnerabilities could be exploited by attackers to gain unauthorized access to sensitive data or to<br>
        compromise the integrity of our system.<br>

        Impact: The discovered vulnerabilities represent a significant risk to the security of our users and the<br>
        integrity of our data. At worst, they could result in data breaches that will damage our reputation and incur<br>
        significant costs associated with mitigating and recovering from security incidents.<br>

        Proposed Solution: I propose the following measures to address the identified problems:<br>

        Implement thorough input validations across all user entry points.<br>
        Use prepared queries to prevent theft of SQL information.<br>
        Secure data transmission using encryption.<br>
        Perform a full security audit of the code and apply any necessary fixes.<br>
        Establish a regular penetration testing program to identify and resolve future alterations or attempts to steal<br>
        information in the software.<br>

        I appreciate the immediate attention to this critical issue and am confident that by working together, we can<br>
        strengthen the security of our software to protect our users and our organization.<br>
        I remain available to coordinate the next steps and provide the necessary support during the implementation of<br>
        these measures.<br>
        <img src="Tooldeep" alt="Tool">        
        Kind regards.<br>

        Tomas Zarate (CEO)<br>
